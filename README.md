# Wikipedia Scraper

A Python project that fetches information about world leaders via API, scrapes their biographies from Wikipedia, and exports everything into a JSON file. Built as part of my learning at BeCode to deepen experience with APIs, web scraping, and data handling using Python

## üöÄ Current Feature

- Grabs a list of countries and their political leaders via [this API](https://country-leaders.onrender.com/docs).
- Visits each leader‚Äôs Wikipedia page to scrape their bio (first paragraph only)
- Cleans the text to remove footnotes and clutter
- Stores everything in a JSON file
- Keeps track of any broken or missing Wikipedia links

## üõ† Tech

- **Language:** Python 3
- **Libraries:** `requests`, `beautifulsoup4`, `json`, `csv`, `re`

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Set It Up

1. Clone this repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jgchoti/wikipedia-scraper.git
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install the requirements:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run It

```bash
python main.py
```

This program will save data into `leaders.json` inside the `data/` folder

### üìä Sample Output in JSON

```json
{
  "USA": [
    {
      "name": "George Washington",
      "Wikipedia Url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington",

He is commonly known as the Father of the Nation for his role in bringing about American independence."
